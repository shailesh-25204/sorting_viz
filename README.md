# The Sorting-Viz

A simple sorting Visualizer

## Get Started

Just open the deployment page, and play around...

Currently, 3 types of sorting algorithms are present namely Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Selection Sort

You can choose the size of the array between 5 - 250 elements and animation delay is also variable from 10 ms to 500 ms (which can be changed during the animation run).

After Sorting , Time taken for the Sorting animation is displayed on the screen along with final animation delay. 
Along with that, the site is responsive for almost all screen sizes.

This is my First project in web development, so if you like it do give a â˜†.

##Thanks
